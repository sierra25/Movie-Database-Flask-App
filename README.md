# Movie-Database-Flask-App
This is a Movie Database. There is login validation functionality for users. It allows the user to sort movies in the database based on title, year, oldest, most recent, or by keywords. When a user clicks on a movie, other information such as Year, Cast and Genres is displayed. The user can specify the number of movies displayed on a page. I used Python, Flask, and SQLite in this project.
